      How do I approach designing software?
I've approached designing software with determination. 

    What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I've learned to lean on my artistic and coding skills during this class, and new design skills such as working with light directly have helped me. 
 
    What design process did you follow for your project work?
my design process was focused on problem-solving. working towards making goals into reality. 

    How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I'll be applying the same goal-oriented processes to future work, along with the same level of determination. 

    How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs in a similar way as software, with determination and problem-solving techniques. 

    What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I've developed a strategy of searching for the most important questions first, as there are usually a lot of them. 

    How did iteration factor into your development?
Iterations were an important factor in my development process. starting with basic shapes, no textures, just getting basics. moving to adding one addition at a time and testing it. 
 
    How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
 My approach evolved to become a little more sporadic through this milestone. I began to test a little more and try more ideas as things went along.
 
    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science is part of my end goal as I hope to incorporate it into my professional life.

    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? 
 I'm hoping to continue with my BA this class was an important part of that educationally. 
 
    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I'm hoping to continue in the field of technology this class was important.
